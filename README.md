🚀 AI Multi-Model Assistant App

An intelligent, Flutter-based AI assistant that uses multiple AI models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama) and automatically selects the best and most cost-efficient model for every task.

This app is designed to make AI simple, fast, affordable, and useful for real users.

✨ Key Highlights

🧠 Multi-Model AI Support
Use GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama — all inside one app.

⚡ Task-Adaptive Model Routing
The app automatically picks the best model based on the query type.

💸 Smart Cost Optimization
Simple tasks → cheaper models
Complex tasks → powerful models
Saves up to 50% cost.

🎤🖼️ Multimodal AI (Voice + Image + Text)
Upload images, speak through the mic, or chat normally.
The app handles everything automatically — no setup required.

🗂️ Generative UI Cards
AI answers become actionable components like:

To-do lists

Steps

Plans

Task cards
instead of plain text.

🔐 Firebase Authentication
Secure login and user management.

☁️ Cloud Functions
Fast processing of heavy tasks using backend functions.

🎨 Modern UI & Themes
Smooth, customizable interface with light/dark theme support.

🧩 Why This App Is Unique

Most AI apps use only one AI model (like ChatGPT or Gemini).
This leads to:

❌ Higher cost
❌ Slower performance
❌ Limited capabilities
❌ Poor handling of images/voice
❌ No task automation

This app solves all of these problems through:

✔ Multi-Model Freedom

One app, many models.

✔ Intelligent Routing

Right model for the right task.

✔ Multimodal Simplicity

Images + Voice + Text = fully automatic.

✔ Actionable Outputs

AI doesn’t just give text — it gives usable components.
